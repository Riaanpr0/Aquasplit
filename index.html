    <h1>AquaSplit: Turning Dirty Water Into Safe Drinking Water</h1>
    <p>A simple solution for outdoor survival and clean water access</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>üö® The Problem</h2>
    <p>In outdoor environments like hiking or camping, clean drinking water can be hard to find. Natural sources such as rivers or ponds may contain harmful impurities. Our project investigates whether simple distillation can purify dirty water to make it drinkable.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>üîç Our Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>We hypothesized that if we distilled dirty water, the output would be clear, safe, and neutral in pH. This is because distillation removes solids and most contaminants.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>‚öóÔ∏è Method</h2>
    <p>We heated 100 mL of a sand and water mixture until it evaporated. The vapor condensed and was collected in a clean container. We controlled the volume, heating time, and collection setup for consistency.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>üìä Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Collected 50 mL of pure water from 100 mL input</li>
      <li>Water appeared crystal clear with no residue</li>
      <li>pH level: Neutral (7.0)</li>
      <li>Residue: Sandy particles left behind</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This confirms that distillation successfully removed physical impurities and made the water safe to drink.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>‚úÖ Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The AquaSplit device effectively purifies dirty water using distillation. The resulting water is clear, neutral in pH, and safe for consumption. This method can be life-saving in survival situations, emergency zones, or remote areas.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>üöÄ Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use solar reflectors or fireless heating methods</li>
      <li>Add pre-filters to remove bacteria before distillation</li>
      <li>Improve cooling system to increase output</li>
      <li>Test with other water sources like seawater and juice</li>
    </ul>
